Note: to run this project on Windows or Linux/Mac with the embedded DB H2 (easiest way):
0. If running on topcat, edit src/main/resources/application.properties and
  set the port to one of your assigned ports, preferably xxxx3 to follow
  our conventions (for example, 51303). See CS636Ports.html for your ports.

1. Drop and load the music database (the tables have changed a little)
   cd to the database directory here.
   and use the db tools there, same as in pizza1 and music1 and pizza3
   
2. Use "mvn clean package" when cd'd to this directory to build/rebuild the jar

3. On Linux or Mac, use "chmod +x *.sh" to make all shell scripts in this directory
 executable, and similarly for the database directory. 

4. Run the program to start tomcat with the webapp: using convenience script
    runJarByProfile h2 web  (Windows)   
or  runJarByProfile.sh h2 web (Linux or Mac)
or using mvn directly (see contents of runMvnByProfile). Either way, let it hang.

5. Browse to localhost:9003/welcome.html to see the top-level page. Replace 9003 here
with your own port ending in 3 if running on topcat.

6. Run all the JUnit tests with mvn test. They are also run during mvn package.

7. The old line-oriented programs can be run outside of tomcat:
    runJarByProfile h2 SystemTest  (Windows)   (or TakeOrder or ShopAdmin)
or  runJarByProfile.sh h2 SystemTest  (Linux or Mac)
or  runMvnByProfile h2 SystemTest, etc.

To use a real DB: you need to define environment variables (same as for music1)
 For Oracle database, set up env variables ORACLE_USER, ORACLE_PW, ORACLE_SITE
 For MySQL use, set up env vars MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PW, MYSQL_SITE
Then these are accessed from the profiles to setup the JDBC config.
So you can run simply  runJarByProfile oracle web   for example, and
let it hang.  Use a browser to run the webapp as in step 5.

Inside eclipse:
For development and debugging, run SBApplication as a Java app inside eclipse,
or debug as a Java app. By default these will run the web case using Oracle.
To run using H2, define an eclipse Run configuration with VM arg 
-Dspring.profiles.active=h2 (look in the Arguments tab). To run SystemTest, 
add the program arg SystemTest in the Arguments tab.

Note: if H2 executions are giving funny errors, esp. ones complaining about accessing 
pages, just reinitialize it: cd to your home directory (c:\Users\username on Windows)
and delete file test-music.mv.db, then reload the db
