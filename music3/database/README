Various ways to load, drop, and look at the database
1. If you have ant installed at home, it gives you one way that works both on 
topcat and at home, once you have defined ORACLE_USER, etc.
On topcat, ant is already installed.
ant load-oradb
ant show-oradb
ant drop-oradb
ant load-mysqldb
ant show-mysqldb
ant drop-mysqldb
ant load-h2
ant show-h2
ant drop-h2

2. For database H2, runH2Script.sh/runH2Script.cmd works for all platforms:
runH2Script.sh createdb.sql   (for Windows, drop the .sh)
runH2Script.sh showdb.sql
runH2Script.sh dropdb.sql
Note that you'll have two H2 databases, one on topcat, one on your home system.

Scripts for mysql and oracle: these all depend on env vars ORACLE_USER, etc.
runOracleScript.sh and runMysqlScript.sh run on only on topcat, using
   the system programs sqlplus and mysql. 
For home use, try these shell scripts that use a JDBC program to run the SQL script remotely.
runOracleScriptJDBC.sh createdb.sql, etc. (for Windows, drop the .sh)
runMysqlScriptJDBC.sh createdb.sql, etc.
